# Node.js Project with Express and MongoDB

This project is an example of basic configuration for a Node.js project using Express for the web server and MongoDB as the database.

## Getting Started

After cloning this repository, follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Then, install project dependencies by running the following command at the root of the project:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create .env file**: Create a `.env` file at the root of the project to add necessary environment variables. Here's an example content for the `.env` file:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name
   ```

3. **Start the Server**: Launch the server by running the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the Application**: Once the server is running, you can access the application at the following URL in your web browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:4000
   ```

## Environment Variables

The `.env` file is used to store environment variables required for the application to function. Currently, only the `MONGODB_URI` variable is required to connect to the MongoDB database.

Ensure not to add the `.env` file to version control (do not include it in Git) for security reasons. You can add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to avoid publishing it accidentally.
